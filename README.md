# Tektim-Bot
Creating a discord bot to take my place

## Things to do
1. Create internal tools for dataset production
2. Scrape servers for data (my messages and context)
3. Use tools to produce the dataset
4. Preprocess data
5. Research model selection
6. Tune a model for text responses that performs well enough
7. Specify and implement rules for bot interaction
8. Deploy bot on alternative device (looking at you raspberry pi)

This should all be done in a manner that does not inhibit future work.

## Future Work
1. Modify internal tools to work with tagging images
2. Choose another model for image classification (cringe or funny)
3. Funny AI multiple choice game? Discord interaction most likely
